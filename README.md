### Installation
**Make sure you have all necessary requirements installed (click, prettytable)**

* If you want to keep the file readable, run `bash py_install.sh` (Recommended as it's faster)
    * Note that this method requires python to be installed on the computer that the file is run on, so don't transfer the file to other computers
* If you want to conver the file to an executable, run `bash exe_install.sh` (Not recommended as it's slower)
